| 	bitor
~ 	compl
! 	not
!= 	not_eq
|| 	or
|= 	or_eq
^ 	xor
^= 	xor_eq
{ 	<%
} 	%>
[ 	<:
] 	:>
# 	%:
## 	%:%:

The same words are defined in the C programming language in the include file <iso646.h> as macros. Because in C++ these are built into the language,
 the C++ version of <iso646.h>, as well as <ciso646>, does not define anything.
